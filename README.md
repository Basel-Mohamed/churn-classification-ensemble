# 🔮 Customer Churn Prediction & AI Assistant

An end-to-end AI solution that combines **Classical Machine Learning** with **Large Language Models (LLM)** to predict customer churn. This project features a robust training pipeline, a Flask REST API, and a conversational chatbot interface that allows marketing teams to assess customer risk using natural language.

## 📌 Project Overview

This system helps telecom retention teams identify at-risk customers early and suggests actionable strategies to prevent churn.

* **Problem:** Predicting whether a customer will leave (`Churn`) based on demographics, services, and billing behavior.
* **Solution:** An **Ensemble Voting Classifier** (Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression + AdaBoost) for high stability and generalization.
* **Key Innovation:** An **LLM-powered Agent** (via Groq API) that acts as a friendly interface, gathering customer details conversationally before triggering the prediction model.
* **Performance:** The model achieves:
    * **Accuracy:** ~82%
    * **Retention Recall:** ~90% 
    * **F1-Score:** ~87%

# 🚀 Setup & Installation
## 1. Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

## 2. Clone the Repository
Bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Basel-Mohamed/ea_task.git

cd ea-Task
```
## 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
## 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# 🛠️ How to Run

## Step 1: Train the Model

Before running the API, you must train the model to generate the necessary artifacts (.pkl files) in the models/ directory.

```bash
python train.py
```
* This script will:
* Load the data
* Clean it
* Engineer features
* Train the Random Forest model
* Save the trained artifacts


## Step 2: Start the API Server

Once training is complete, start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn api.app:app --reload
```
The server will start at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000

```

# 🔌 API Endpoints

1. Health Check

URL: ```GET /```
Description: Checks if the API is running and the model is loaded.

2. Predict Sales

URL: ```POST /predict```
Description: Returns churn probability and risk level for raw structured data.

## 📊 Key Features
### ✅ Advanced Ensemble Modeling
Combines Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost.

Uses Soft Voting for calibrated probability estimation.

### ✅ Robust Engineering
Label Encoding: Handles categorical variables automatically.

Scaling: Standardizes numerical features for model stability.

Modular Code: Separated logic for data processing, training, and inference.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
* On-Premises LLM Deployment: Move from Groq API to a self-hosted Ollama instance if data privacy requirements become stricter and GPU infrastructure becomes available.

* Database Integration: Migrate to PostgreSQL to store long-term customer history.

* Model Monitoring: Implement a dashboard to track prediction accuracy over time and detect data drift.

* Automated Retraining: Implement MLOps pipelines (e.g., using Airflow) to retrain the model monthly on fresh data.
